# Bonds
Bonds are the relationships that PCs have that they can draw upon to push through and survive the world.

## Generating Bonds
PCs start with bonds with all of their guildmembers. A PC might also generate a bond with an NPC during the course of play which work the same way. Bonds have destinct titles such as "lovers" or "siblings" that succinctly describe the relationship between the two charaters.

## Charging Bonds
Whenever a PC does something dangerous or risky that helps reincofrce the relationship of one of their bonds, that bond becomes charged. For example:
- A PC charging into combat to free their lover from the maws of a beast.
- A PC performing a risky maneuver to show off to their rival.
- A PC eschewing medical supplies to make sure their sibling is healed first.

A PC can spent the charge of a bond to not gain fatigue when they otherwise would.
