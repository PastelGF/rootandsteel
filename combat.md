# Combat

## Turns
Combat is divided into (usually 10 second) long turns. During each turn, a character can take two actions, usually moving and attacking, but can take each action only once. Some actions require a full turn, consuming both actions.

## Zones
When combat starts, the battlefield is divided into zones. Each zone is a single space around 40 feet in size. A creature can move anywhere within a zone freely, but in order to move between zones it must use an action. Melee weapons can freely attack anything in their current zone, and ranged weapons can attack up to two zone away.

For example, a battle on a ship might use the zones of: the front deck of the ship, the main deck of the ship, the back deck of the ship, the crow's nest of the ship, and the crew quarter's beneath the ship.

Effects that blast target an entire zone.

## Initiative
At the start of each turn, the Warden telegraphs all actions of the enemies. For example, the Warden might announce that the orc points their blade at a PC, or that the warlock begins to chant some horrid spell.

Then, the PCs announce their actions. The PCs must succeed on a DEX save or the enemies go before them. PCs and enemies can also choose to forgo their second action to go before other combatants. If members of both sides choose to do this, resolve this with a DEX save as well.

## Attacking
Weapons come in three sizes, fast (d6), medium (d8), and slow (d10). Whenever a character attacks, they roll their die and subtract the value from their foe's HP. If any damage is left over, or if the target has no HP, damage is dealt directly to STR.

If the target is unaware, their HP is irrelevant and damage is done directly to STR.

If a creature attacks another and does not kill it, those creatures are engaged. The exception is with a reach weapon. Attacking a creature with a reach weapon does not engage them.

If two creatures attack each other, they deal damage at the same time, with the excpetion of reach weapons. Reach weapons deal damage before other weapons unless the creatures are engaged, in which case they deal damage after. 

### Armor
If a character has armor, any damage they take is first subtracted by their armor. Armor cannot be greater than 3.

### Improvised Weapons
Improvised weapons (AKA: Anything that is not intended to be a weapon) deal damage as a weapon of equivalency. A bottle dealls damage like a dagger (d6), a chair leg like a mace (d8), or a chair itself like a greatsword (d10). Improvised weapons break after rolling damage higher than half of their die's value.

Unarmed attacks deal a d4 damage, but are otherwise treated as fast.

### Critical Damage
Whenever a creature takes STR damage it must make a STR save. If it fails, it takes CRITICAL DAMAGE. A PC that takes CRITICAL DAMAGE is barely concious, only able to crawl, and requires medical attention. A non-PC that takes CRITICAL DAMAGE dies.

Some enemies have unique abilities that trigger when a PC fails a CRITICAL DAMAGE save.

## Defending Yourself
When a PC is attacked, they may gain a fatigue take one of the following 3 options:

- **Block:** To attempt to block with a weapon, shield, or armor, roll a STR save. You must have a shield. If succesful, the attack is Impaired.
- **Dodge:** To attempt to dodge, roll a DEX save. It must also be greater than the value of your armor, and you cannot dodge while wielding a slow weapon. If succesful, the attack is impaired.
- **Parry:** To attempt a parry, roll your weapon's damage die against an enemy that is attacking you. If your roll is greater, you deal damage to the opponent's STR, but trigger no CRITICAL DAMAGE save. If their roll is greater, they deal damage to your STR, but trigger no CRITICAL DAMAGE save. If both rolls are equal, nothing happens.

## Attack Modifiers
If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is impaired and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage regardless of the attacks damage die.

If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is enhanced, allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.

## Multiple Attackers
If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

## Dual Weapons
If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.

## Retreating
Running away from combat can be done if you are at least one zone away from the nearest enemy, succeed on a DEX save, and have a safe place to retreat too.
