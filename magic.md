# Haustoriamancy
Haustoriamancy (or enchanting to the uneducated) is a form of lesser magic involving empowering items. Any PC can become a haustoriamancer, but those who are untrained must be trained during a city watch for a price of 100 sp.

## Ley-Items
To perform haustoriamancy, a ley-item is required. Ley-items are springs of magical power, and usually take the form of deeply sentimental items. All ley-items must be made entirely of non-conductive materials such as wood or bone or cloth, and are usually priceless, and useless to any but their wielder. Ley-items also act as a fast (d6) weapon, regardless of what they are made of or their form, as an enchanter can manipulate it into a wepaon.

## Enchanting

To enchant, a haustoriamancer uses their ley-item to infuse magical energy into an item, with the following restrictions:

- Items must be non-conductive. Magic does not like metal.
- Items must be a single item. You can enchant a bag filled with dust, but not the dust within the bag.
- Items must be solid. Water is not an object, but ice is.

To enchant an item, a huastoriamancer gains fatigue and expends an action (if in combat), and then afterwards can command the item to do something that fits for that item. For example:

- A candle explodes into a large puddle of slippery wax.
- A rope attempts to bind someone like a serpent of its own will.
- A quill writes a message on a paper when a certain trigger is met.
- A torch shatters into a storm of sharp splinters.
- A bag of dust explodes into an obscuring cloud.
- An arrow flies an impossible path.

After performing its duties, an enchanted item crumbles to dust if not destroyed by its action. The effects of these commands are up to interpretation. Creative use of items carries the day.

## Other Froms of Haustoriamancy
Trained enchanters can gain access to other forms of haustoriamancy, unlocking additional abilities through more training (same as unlokcing haustoriamancy). Some forms of advanced enchanting are illegal, and performing them is a crime, and will be labelled as such.

### Ley-Combat
One can learn to master the power of their ley-enchanted item. Ley-combatants can turn their item into any weapon (with its associated damage die), and use that weapons category ability, if the enchanter is trained in that weapon type.

### Fletchmagic
One can learn to infuse magic into arrows, using their ley-item as a bow. Trained fletchmages use quivers of specialized arrows (20 sp) to perform their magic. These arrows work as if fired from a lonbow (d8 damage, can attack up to two zones away), with the addition of any magic implanted in them.

### Wind (Aeromancy)
As wind is a obviously alive. Unlike other forms of haustoriamancy, to learn to control the wind you must first bargain with it by climbing onto the highest peak in the region and offering something of great value to the wind (the giants bargained their voices). Once you and the wind reach accord, you cam now bind to breezes and command the wind.

### Fire (Pyromancy)
One can learn to enchant flames, allowing them to guide the flame (not command) and increase its size and temperature. As fires are, of course, alive, they have minds of their own and will obey less and less the larger they get. Pyromancy is illegal. 

### Bones (Ossomancy)
One can animate the bones of the dead (a complete skeleton is a single object, after all) into unthinking, but utterly devoted thralls. Only capable of simple tasks, such as hauling goods or pointing a spear at something and as effective at those tasks as any animated skeleton would reasonably be. Ossomancy is not necromancy, as you are only animating the bones, not returning them to unlife. Ossomancy is also illegal, but only on moral grounds.

### Body (Biomancy)
One can manipulate their own blood, organs, and flesh through enchanting like they would any other object. Such options include:

- Using your intestines like a whip or rope
- Turning your nails into claws to use as natural weapons or to climb a tree
- Altering your face and body to be uncrecognizable.

Biomancy takes extreme toll on the body, causing 1d6 points of strength damage after an enchantment is finished. Legends tell of powerful biomancers being able to manipulate the biologoy of other beings, most notably to create the ketch, also known as the worst predator to ever exist. Biomancy is illegal.

### Dreams (Oneiromancy)
~~There is no magic in dreams.~~

Finding training in oneiromancy is difficult. There are few practitioner, and those who are hunted relentlessly. Oneriomancers can infuse magic into their thoughts to create phantasms of their ideas. These phantasms are real, but only temporarily. These dreams act real, though are obviously made out of thin magenta light, rather than flesh. Dreaming things into existence is extremely taxing mentally, causing 1d6 points of willpower damage. Oneiromancy is extremely illegal, and practitioners are hunted with the utmost priority.
