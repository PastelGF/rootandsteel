# Rules
## Ability Scores
There are three ability scores:
- **Strength (STR)**: Used for saves involving physical might and constitution.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves involving agility and speed.
- **Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves involving force of personality and ability to push through suffering.

## Saves
A save is a roll to avoid danger. Saves are ONLY rolled in dangerous scenarios. Given infinite time and space, you will always succeed.

Roll a d20, and if the roll is lower than the respective ability score, you succeed. If not, you fail.

## Hit Protection
All characters have hit protection (HP). HP is a representation of luck and will to fight that is wittled down in place of more permanent ability score damage.

HP is fully restored after a short breather, approximately a minute of peace.

## Ability Score Damage
Serious injury is represented by a reduction to one of the three ability scores. Strength is most commonly lost when taking critical damage.

Ability scores are restored at a rate of 1 per night of rest in a comfortable environment.

- A character with a STR score of 0 dies.
- A character with a DEX score of 0 is paralyzed.
- A character with a WIL of 0 is stupefied.

## Resting and Fatigue
A character deprived of a need (food, water, sleep) is unable to heal or restore ability scores. If a character is deprived for a full day or more, they gain a fatigue.

Comfortable rest is only performed in truly safe areas, such as a city.

## Inventory and Slots
A character's inventory is measured by 10 slots. Items occupy slots. The first four slots are for items the character has actively held or equipped, and the next 6 represent items in their pack.

Some items are petty. They do not take up a slot. Some items are bulky. They take up two slots.

A character with all slots filled is incapable of fighitng.

## Turns
Time in Root and Steel is measured in turns and watches. Turns and watches are not a set amount of time, but instead whatever feels most appropriate to the moment.

In combat, time is measured in turns. A combat turn is usually 10 seconds, but may be more.

While exploring, time is measured in watches. In a dungeon, a watch can be anywhere from 5-30 minutes. During open terrain exploration, a watch can be anywhere from 6-12 hours. While resting in a city or other safe place, a watch can be up to several full months.

## Wealth
Currency is measured in terms of silver coins (sp). 100 silver coins is worth a gold coin. 100 copper coins is worth a gold coin.

100 coins occupies a single slot. Anything less than that is petty.

## Fatigue
Whenever a character gains fatigue, they cross off a slot.

Fatigue is removed with a night of rest with all needs filled.

## Reaction Roll
If the PCs encounter a creature and iit is not clear how it wiill react to them, the Warden may use the following table:

|2|3-5|6-8|9-11|12|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Hostile|Wary|Curious|Friendly|Helpful|

## The Encounter Table
When the PCs explore a dungeon or the open world, the Warden is likely to find a table of random events helpful in keeping the game interesting. A table of sorts should be specific to the area the party is in (the environ or the level of the dungeon), and should follow a format similar to the following:

|Roll (d20)|Recommended Entry|
|:----|:----|
|1-5|**Torches Flicker:** Mark a use on all lit torches. After 3 uses, they are burnt up.|
|6-9|**Curiosity:** A small and self contained weirdness. Not an encounter, just something neat.|
|10-15|**Non-Creature Encounter:** Either a terrain encounter (giant ravine) or a spark for party roleplay|
|16-19|**Creature Encounter:** Encounters with creatures, friend or foe. Use the reaction roll if necessary.|
|20|**Quest Hook:** A rumor or hook for the party to engage with. Perhaps news of an unknown dungeon.|

This table should be used after every watch or two, or whenever the PCs do something loud, reckless, stupid, or of questionable intelligence. Once a roll has been used, it is marked off of the table with the exception of torches flickering. Once the party returns to safety to rest, all tables are refreshed.

## Light and Darkness
In Root and Steel, Darkness is a malevolent force that seeks to corrupt and twist the minds of those within it. Darkness isn't just light shadows, Darkness is all consuming ink blackness, found in the darkest forests and the deepest dungeons.

Any PC that spends a watch in the Dark takes 1d6 WIL damage and then makes a WIL save. On a failure, they go mad and are lost to the Darkness.

Torches and other light sources fight back the Darkness. A torch sheds enough light to light up a zone (about 40') and to provide some vision into any adjacent zones. Torches have three uses (used when torches flicker).
