# Rules
## Ability Scores
There are three ability scores:
- **Strength (STR)**: Used for saves involving physical might and constitution.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves involving agility and speed.
- **Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves involving force of personality and ability to push through suffering.

## Saves
A save is a roll to avoid danger. Saves are ONLY rolled in dangerous scenarios. Given infinite time and space, you will always succeed.

Roll a d20, and if the roll is lower than the respective ability score, you succeed. If not, you fail.

## Hit Protection
All characters have hit protection (HP). HP is a representation of luck and will to fight that is wittled down in place of more permanent ability score damage.

HP is fully restored after a short breather, approximately a minute of peace.

## Ability Score Damage
Serious injury is represented by a reduction to one of the three ability scores. Strength is most commonly lost when taking critical damage.

Ability scores are restored at a rate of 1 per night of rest in a comfortable environment.

## Resting and Fatigue
A character deprived of a need (food, water, sleep) is unable to heal or restore ability scores. If a character is deprived for a full day or more, they gain a fatigue.

Comfortable rest is only performed in truly safe areas, such as a city.

## Inventory and Slots
A character's inventory is measured by 10 slots. Items occupy slots. The first four slots are for items the character has actively held or equipped, and the next 6 represent items in their pack.

Some items are petty. They do not take up a slot. Some items are bulky. They take up two slots.

A character with all slots filled is incapable of fighitng.

## Turns
Time in Root and Steel is measured in turns and watches. Turns and watches are not a set amount of time, but instead whatever feels most appropriate to the moment.

In combat, time is measured in turns. A combat turn is usually 10 seconds, but may be more.

While exploring, time is measured in watches. In a dungeon, a watch can be anywhere from 5-30 minutes. During open terrain exploration, a watch can be anywhere from 6-12 hours. While resting in a city or other safe place, a watch can be up to several full months.

## Wealth
Currency is measured in terms of silver coins (sp). 100 silver coins is worth a gold coin. 100 copper coins is worth a gold coin.

100 coins occupies a single slot. Anything less than that is petty.

## Fatigue
Whenever a character gains fatigue, they cross off a slot.

Fatigue is removed with a night of rest with all needs filled.
