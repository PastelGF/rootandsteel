## Soldier
*Your trade is violence, a professional man-at-arms and veteran.*

For each Soldier event you have, get training in a weapon type.

What war are you a veteran of?
- The Coin Wars, as part of a professional military. Get leather armor (1 armor, bulky) and a musket (d10 firearm, bulky).
- The Second Little War, a short, but violent, conflict. Get a shield and a spear (d8 polearm).
- The Consortium Wars. Rough business, but good pay. Get a longsword (d8 straightsword) and a dagger (d6 dagger).
- The Northern Conflict. Short skirmishes, rather than real battle. Get a helmet and a longbow (d8 bow, bulky).

## Petty Thief
*A simple criminal, you did what you must to get by. Or perhaps you're just greedy.*

For each Petty Thief event you have, get a favor from the thieves' guild.

What did you steal?
- Hearts. You were a charlatan, a lying performer. Get an instrument and a rapier (d8 thrusting sword).
- Simple coin. You were not a compelx thief. Get a dagger (d6 dagger) and an armored cloak (1 armor, bulky).
- Art. It was a complicated trade, but it was worth it. Get thieves supplies and a grappling hook (petty) and rope.
- Does it matter? You got caught. +1 HP and +1 WIL, but you are missing a hand.

## Academic
*You are of the learned sort, but not a practitioner of alchemy or magic.*
