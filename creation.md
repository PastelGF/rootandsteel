# Character Creation

## Ability Scores
To determine your STR, DEX, and WIL, roll 3d6 for each in order. You may then swap two of your ability scores.

## Hit Protection
To determing your hit protection, roll a d6.

## Starting Items
All characters start with:

- 1 torch (3 uses)
- 1 ration (3 uses)
- 3d6 sp 

## Backgrounds and Events
Your characters backgrounds define their past and their starting skills and items. Backgrounds pose a question which is answered by events. Each character has 3 events, which can be split among any number of backgrounds (you may pick 3 events from one background, if you wish).

Some backgrounds are defining. They pose two questions, and you must pick at least one event for each question. You may only pick one defining background.

If a character is of advanced age, you may represent this by reducing your STR, DEX, and WIL by 1 each and gaining an additional event.

## Name and Traits
Afterwards, decide your character's name, look, and character traits.
