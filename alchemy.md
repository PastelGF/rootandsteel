# Alchemy
Alchemy is the divine science, using natural understanding and complex processies to develop an understanding of the natural world. Alchemy is sued to create alchemical items, dividied into 5 categories: bombs, elixirs, perfumes, gadgets, and prosthesis. Alchemy requires an alchmical station (bulky, 50 sp) to use, though stations exist in all cities.

## Field Alchemy
Field alchemy is used to create crude alchemical items out of resources harvested in the field. Field alchemy requires an alchemical station and a hermetic bottle (10 sp).

Over the course of a watch, an alchemist can harvest part of a dead monster, or a rare plant or fungus, and use it to create a single use alchemical item (bomb, elixir, or perfume). The item takes the traits of the item harvested (decided upon during crafting).

For example, a giant spider might yield a bomb that explodes into sticky webs, or an elixer that allows temporary spider climbing.
