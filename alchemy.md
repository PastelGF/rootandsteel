# Alchemy
Alchemy is the divine science, using natural understanding and complex processies to develop an understanding of the natural world. Alchemy is sued to create alchemical items, dividied into 5 categories: bombs, elixirs, perfumes, gadgets, and prosthesis. Alchemy requires an alchmical station (bulky, 50 sp) to use, though stations exist in all cities.

- Bombs explode in a blast, thrown as a blast into an adjacent zone (40').
- Elixers are potions, poisons, or salves that are applieod as an action.
- Perfumes are sprays of gas or small particles, sprayed into an adjacent zone (40').
- Gadgets are small technical devices that perform a specific effect.
- Prosthesis replace a part of the human body with a mechanical piece.

## Field Alchemy
Field alchemy is used to create crude alchemical items out of resources harvested in the field. Field alchemy requires an alchemical station and a hermetic bottle (10 sp).

Over the course of a watch, an alchemist can harvest part of a dead monster, or a rare plant or fungus, and use it to create a single use alchemical item (bomb, elixir, or perfume). The item takes the traits of the item harvested (decided upon during crafting).

For example, a giant spider might yield a bomb that explodes into sticky webs, or an elixer that allows temporary spider climbing.

## True Alchemy
Advanced alchemy is a long and complicated process. It can only be performed in a city over the course of a city watch. Any number of alchemical items can be made in this time.

To perform true alchemy, an alchemist needs ingredients and a formula. Ingredients come in two tiers, common and exotic. An ingredient is at least one slot of a material. Common ones are easily available and can be found in the wilds in spade, but exotic ones come from rare and limited resources (such as the horn of a unicorn). Due to alchemical equivalence, any ingredient can be used to create any item, as long as tiers are adhered too. Formulae can be purchesed or found during an adventure.
