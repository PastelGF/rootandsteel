# Alchemy
Alchemy is the divine science, using natural understanding and complex processies to develop an understanding of the natural world. Alchemy is sued to create alchemical items, dividied into 5 categories: bombs, elixirs, and perfumes. Alchemy requires an alchmical station (bulky, 50 sp) to use, though stations exist in all cities.

- Bombs explode in a blast, thrown as a blast into an adjacent zone (40').
- Elixers are potions, poisons, or salves that are applieod as an action.
- Perfumes are sprays of gas or small particles, sprayed into an adjacent zone (40').

## Field Alchemy
Field alchemy is used to create crude alchemical items out of resources harvested in the field. Field alchemy requires an alchemical station and a hermetic bottle (10 sp).

Over the course of an exploration watch, one trained in field alchemy can harvest part of a dead monster, or a rare plant or fungus, and use it to create a single use alchemical item (bomb, elixir, or perfume). The item takes the traits of the item harvested (decided upon during crafting).

For example, a giant spider might yield a bomb that explodes into sticky webs, or an elixer that allows temporary spider climbing.

## High Alchemy
High alchemy is an academic art allowing one to craft valuable items of immense rarity nad power. To craft such an item, an alchemist needs a slot worth of rare ingredient and/or coin. If the ingredient is provided, the cost of high alchemy is reduced by a factor of 10. Most alchemists are also willing to purchase ingredients for half the price they would take to craft the item. Prices for high alchemical items are not set in stone, and vary every city watch.

## Prosthetics
Alchemy can be used to replace lost body parts, or to enhance what is there.

- Minor prosthetics are cosmetic in nature, such as replacing a lost nose or finger. They provide no effect and cost 50 sp.
- Moderate prosthetics restore lost functionality but provide no benefit, such as replacing a hand, foot, or eye. They provide no extra effect and cost 100 sp.
- Major prosthetics replace large portions of the body and grant additional benefit, such as replacing an arm or heart. They cost 250 sp.
  -   Replacement arms work like normal and increase unarmed damage to 1d6.
  -   Replacement legs work like normal and allow one to move twice in a single turn.
  -   Replacement organs (not brain) work like normal and grant 1 additional HP.

Prosthetics can only be applied to a living body.
