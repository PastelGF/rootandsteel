# Grayspeaking
Grayspeaking is a little-known art, the ability to define the rules of the universe, if only for a moment. Grayspeaking is not magic, but anti-magic. It undoes the effects of enchanting and magitech. ANy PC can become a grayspeaker, but those who are untrained must be trained during a city watch for a price of 100 sp.

## Tongues
Men are a species of entropy. We may build civilizations and cities, but ultimately we ruin the world with entropy. Thus, grayspeaking is usually impossible for us without help. That help comes in the form of tongues.

Literal tongues, cut from the mouths of grayspeakers, either the rare human grayspeaker or horrible creatures cooked up in Darkness who speak the gray tongue. Tongues hold but one word, determined when it is cut from its host-throat. Tongues are stored in a tongue bag (50 silver) which can hold 20 total tongues. Here are some example tongues:

|Roll (d12)|Noun|Verb|
|:----|:----|:----|
|1|You|Stop|
|2|Us|Deny|
|3|Me|Forget|
|4|They|Remember|
|5|Air|Fall|
|6|Stone|Raise|
|7|Unknown|Hurt|
|8|Plant|Believe|
|9|Concept|Sink|
|10|Wrongness|Sulk|
|11|Body|Slow|
|12|Dream|Rest|

Legends also tell of tongues that contain conjuctions (and, or, but).

## Speaking the Gray Tongue
To perform their art, a grayspeaker requries two tongues, a noun and a verb. By gaining fatigue and using an action. they press the tongues to their lips and use them to speak. Grayspeaking is NOT magic, it works exclusively in the realm of possibility, ie: nothing a grayspeaker can do would be impossible without grayspeaking. For example:

- Telling **YOU** to **FORGET** might cause a guard to give up chasing a thief, now believing it to have just been their imagination.
- Telling **AIR** to **FALL** might cause a deep fog to envolop an area.
- Telling **WRONGNESS** to **SLOW** might cause a monster to grow weary and weak.

Using conjuctions, a grayspeaker might be able to string multiple commands together, however all nouns require exactly one verb.
