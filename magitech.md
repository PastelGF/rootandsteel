# Magitech
Traditional magic is a dead art, only accessed in the bowels of ancient ruins in the form of magitech.

## Magitech Items
Magitech devices contain a single spell and take up one slot. 

Magitech take the form of physical items that take apperances realted to what they do. A magitech device that allows one to read any language might appear as a visor you place over your eyes, and a magitech device that shoots fireballs might appear as a gun.

Scrolls are single use magitech devices that are petty and do not cause fatigue gain.

## Casting Spells via Magitech
Anyone can cast a spell by using a magitech advice. They then gain a fatigue, occupying one slot. Given time and safety, PCs can enhance a spellâ€™s impact (e.g., affecting multiple targets, increasing its power, etc.) without any additional cost. If the PC is deprived or in danger, the Warden may require a PC to make a WIL save to avoid any ill-effects from casting the spell. Consequences of failure are on par with the intended effect, and may result in added Fatigue, the destruction of the Spellbook, injury, and even death.
